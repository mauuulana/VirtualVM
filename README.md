# VirtualVM
This is a project my exercise on Swift. Virtual Vending Machine is the vending machine on virtual with sell drink. We can input the money, then choose the brand or type of drink you want, after that we can get our drink and we can get the return of money if have a return, or if the money is lacking, we can see the warning.
